# Predictive-Modeling-R

Supermarket manager want to predict if a customer will by Organics food or not.

There are some customer infomation given : 
ID, Influence, Age, Gender, Region, Neighborhood group, Loyalty class, Total amount spent, Time as a member and TargetBuy(1/0)

I put much emphasis on Preprocessing, including deleting outliers, transforming categoricak values, variable scaling, redundancy deduction and processing missings (KNN Imputation).

Visualization is also a greate part in the project.

Then split the data into traning and testing, and train the data by Logistic Regression / Neural Network / KNN algorithm.

Finally the highest accuracy comes to Neural Network (0.823).
